Sample program output generated by specifying its input to the source code of this project: \
[/.sup/sup.txt](https://github.com/Ptysiek/SUP/blob/main/.sup/sup.txt)

</br>

When generating `/.sup/sup.txt` file, names from this file were omitted on purpose: \
[/.sup/.supignore](https://github.com/Ptysiek/SUP/blob/main/.sup/.supignore) \
By modifying this file, you can change the scope of included files. 

</br>

You can generate your own documentation by downloading this precompiled exec: \
[/.sup/sup](https://github.com/Ptysiek/SUP/blob/main/.sup/sup) \
Or by building project yourself: \
&nbsp; - Inside this project directory create new `/build/` catalog, simply next to `/source/`. \
&nbsp; - Open Terminal inside that new catalog `/build/`. \
&nbsp; - Write:  `cmake ..` and press enter to build a project. \
&nbsp; - Write:  `make` to compile.
